# WeatherWatch

React / Node Application utilizing geolocation to grab a user's current latitude and longitude and then make an API weather request for the local weather data.

To run npm install and then yarn start to start the node server. Then cd into client and npm install the React packages and yarn start in another terminal to run the react application.

Still a work in progress.
